                <p>Welcome to my website.

                    My name is Erion Martinaj, I am a 19 year old college student with a passion for cars.
                    Ever since I was younger, my older cousin would bring me to car shows and I admired the different models and designs.
                    I have always been interested in learning about cars. I remember being younger, just driving around with my parents
                    and I would always try to name the brand of the car next to us. Now that I'm older I love learning the mechanics about a car
                    and always willing to learn how to also work on them. I have seen many people around me get cars and then months later
                    start to complain about them whether it be the cars breaking down on them or not being worth the price tag. Looking back,
                    I've noticed it was because people simply don't do the research on the car they purchased, they simply went blindsided
                    and purchased without knowing much about the car.
                    Well since then, I have conducted research on customer criteria for cars and enjoy helping other find their perfect match.

                    My objective is to help you find a car that adheres to you every want while, staying in your respective price range.
                    I have helped hundreds of people while always retaining positive feedback.</p>
